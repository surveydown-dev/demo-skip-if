A demo of how to implement [conditional skipping](https://surveydown.org/config-options#conditional-skipping) in a surveydown survey.

The demo showcases the `skip_if()` and `skip_if_custom()` functions:

1.`skip_if()` is used for basic conditional skipping, where a respondent is sent to a desired page only if a specific response to a specific question is chosen.
2. `skip_if_custom()` is used for custom conditional skipping, where more complex logic can be applied. Users can define any custom function to use as a condition for sending respondents to a given page.
